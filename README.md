# FCC-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects

Below you will find links to my answers to FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects.

1. [Palindrome Checker]()
2. [Roman Numeral Converter]()
3. [Caesars Cipher]()
4. [Telephone Number Validator]()
5. [Cash Register]()

I highly recommend that you try to solve the projects on your own, instead of looking/copying at mines.
